# React App Structure

This React application is organized into the following main directories and files:

### **`public/`**
- Contains static files that are directly served by the web server.
- Includes:
  - `index.html`: The main HTML file for the app.
  - `favicon.ico`, `logo192.png`, `logo512.png`: Icons and logos.
  - `manifest.json`: Configuration for Progressive Web App (PWA) support.
  - `robots.txt`: Instructions for web crawlers.

### **`src/`**
- The main source code for the React app.
- Key subdirectories:
  - **`api/`**: Contains API utility files for interacting with backend services (e.g., `chatApi.js`, `matchingApi.js`).
  - **`assets/`**: Stores static assets like images or fonts.
  - **`components/`**: Reusable UI components such as `AddItem.js`, `ChatMatchCard.js`, and `Tabs.js`.
  - **`constants/`**: Contains constants like `categories.js` and `theme.js` for consistent styling and configuration.
  - **`locales/`**: JSON files for localization (e.g., `ca.json`, `en.json`, `es.json`).
  - **`pages/`**: Page-level components representing different views (e.g., `Chats.js`, `LoginPage.js`, `ProfilePage.js`).
  - **`styles/`**: CSS files for styling the app (e.g., `App.css`, `index.css`).
  - **`utils/`**: Utility functions and helpers (e.g., `firebase.js`, `i18n.js`, `toast.js`).

### **`build/`**
- Contains the production-ready build of the app, generated by `npm run build`.
- Includes:
  - `index.html`: The optimized HTML file.
  - `static/`: Minified CSS, JavaScript, and media files.

### **`Dockerfile`**
- Used to containerize the application for deployment.

### **`nginx.conf`**
